Preface
--------
elf-patcher is a multi-arch patcher, it uses binutils tools for building the hooks.
This tool will patch an elf by creating a leech on a specific instruction which jumps eventually to a code in c.
see examples/example.py and patcher.py for more details.

Files
-------
generate_lds.py:
generate ld script with symbols, and place where you want to patch

patcher.py:
an interface to patch

arch_<arch_name>.py:
every arch should inherit from Arch
the arch will be supported only if it has support in binutils
arch class should define these things:
-binutils_prefix - prefix to binutils tools (like '' for the default binutils and '/opt/arm-linux/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-' for arm)
-get_branch(), get_nop(), get_call(), get_registers_dumper(), get_registers_loader()

Problems
---------
Currently there is no support in:
1. calls and jumps instructions relocations, that means you cannot hook calls and jumps
2. patcher.py:pad_nops() will pad only with one byte nop
3. examples/patches/run_sh fails to compile

Future Goals
-------------
1. Using elffie library will make it possible to create new abilites like extending .text section
